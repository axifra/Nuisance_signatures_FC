# Physiological and motion signatures in static and time-varying functional connectivity and their subject identifiability

This repository provides MATLAB scripts for our work presented in:

A. Xifra-Porxas*, M. Kassinopoulos*, G.D. Mitsis (2021). Physiological and motion signatures in static and time-varying functional connectivity and their subject identifiability. _eLife_, 10:e62324. DOI: 10.7554/eLife.62324. * equal contribution

# Overview of the repository
- [fingerprinting_FC.m](fingerprinting_FC.m): Code to compute the subject identifiability between pairs of scans, based on functional connectivity values.
- [generate_SLFOs.m](generate_SLFOs.m): Code to generate the systemic low frequency oscillations (SLFOs) signal from physiological recordings

More soon...
